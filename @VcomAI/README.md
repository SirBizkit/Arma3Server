# Vcom AI 3.0

## AI Modification: Faster, Smarter, and Deadlier AI.

Vcom AI 3.0 is an AI overhaul modification (Script or Mod) that aims to change the feel of combat in a PvE environment.



What does Vcom AI 3.0 offer?

## Optimizations

For starters, Vcom AI 3.0 offers a noticeable increase of performance over its older counter-part, Vcom AI 2.81.

Functions on a group based FSM system, instead of an individual AI system. Allowing for better FPS, control, and cohesion with AI.

Removed fluff and unnecessary code from Vcom AI 2.81, making the mod/script much more focused.


## Customization

Use the [Userconfig file](https://github.com/genesis92x/VcomAI-3.0/blob/master/userconfig/VCOM_AI/AISettingsV3.hpp) to modify Vcom AI to your liking, or if CBA is running you can modify the [settings in-game and on the fly](https://i.imgur.com/IAsQuIF.png).


## Advanced AI Direction and Threats

* AI will clear garrisoned buildings

* AI will automatically generate waypoints for more interesting and varied combat (AI will not do this if they have certain pre-placed waypoints or more than 1 move waypoint)

* AI move dynamically from cover to cover while following waypoints

* AI will call for on-map artillery for support using Rydygier's Fire For Effect script

* AI will call for reinforcements proportional to the enemy threat

* AI will garrison structures temporarily in combat, if able

* AI will look for nearby static weapons to man

* AI will automatically deploy/pack static weapons

* AI will use satchels to drop buildings, or setup traps for enemies

* AI will use mines to on roads, in buildings, or wherever, to stop enemy movement

* AI will change formations depending on the environment

* AI will attempt to heal themselves or others when out of combat

* AI will attempt to rearm themselves from dead bodies, vehicles, and etc when low

* AI will steal empty or unlocked vehicles

* AI have a chance to ragdoll when shot, causing them to fall over briefly

* AI have an enhanced ability to hear and respond to gunfire from a distance

* AI will respond differently from a weapon that is suppressed or not

* AI on a hold waypoint will garrison a structure indefinitely, or until provided another order

* AI, with NVGs, will be able to see your IR laser and respond accordingly. Be careful where you point that thing!

* AI can have side based/classname based skill settings.


## Ease of use

Vcom AI is easy to use. Install it, throw some units down, and go. It supports AI being spawned in dynamically, so there is no worry about needing to execute the code on every freshly spawned AI.
