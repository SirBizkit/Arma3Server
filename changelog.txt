[X_LIB] Improved fnc_groupGarrison to not select already garrisoned building-positions
[SYS_PROFILE] Fixed profile system not respecting formerly stored units position and always spawning all units on ground in the same spot. Only perform profileGetGoodSpawnPosition on virtualized AI that also control vehicles to increase performance and decrease spawn time (createUnit creates the AI units in safe spots either way). Removed legacy code.
Fixes:
- profiles were always spawned on ground level.
- profiles always spawned at the same spot instead of their last stored unit position.
- much of senseless legacy code
Note:
- if a profile is moved in virtual space (bf.e. y OPCOM) it will therefore also not remain in the originally placed position when spawned again. that is logical and intended.
- if units in a group are placed individually they will return to their formation position. this happens without or with profiled ones, though profiled ones are set directly to their formationpos and won't move for themselves. that is intended.
- init code in units placed in editor has no effect on virtualised units. its same as before.

	_interval call ALiVE_fnc_AutoSave_PNS - see description for usage below:
	!! Health Warning: Uses write-to-file operation which causes the game to hold for about 2 seconds on large data. 
	Will cause desync and lag for that period in MP so ideally use with high intervals and with care !!
	900 call ALiVE_fnc_AutoSave_PNS // put in init.sqf -- will save every 15 minutes
	-1 call ALiVE_fnc_AutoSave_PNS // will disable save

[SYS DATA] Set default to fail with more grace in case wrong settings are used
[VARIOUS] Added option to SYS DATA to persist mission state locally to profileNamespace, which enables persistence for SP, hosted and dedicated server. Integrates with current ALiVE interface and uses already given module-export-data. Does not use @ALiVEServer and therefore does not support webservices (for statistics, AAR, perf monitoring etc. use the proper CouchDB way). Select "ProfileNamespace" on the ALiVE Database module and make sure you have persistence enabled on the other modules, which you want to persist! WARNING: Experimental! Back up your current user and/or server profile folder or define a new one in your startup params! Additional functions: call ALiVE_fnc_ProfileNameSpaceClear in debug >>> will wipe the current mission data (or rename the mission)! call ALiVE_fnc_ProfileNameSpaceWipe will delete all ALiVE related data from profileNamespace (ergo: delete all missions).

[X LIB] Added data functions to save / load mission data to / from profileNamespace to persist data without database
Example:
_saved = ["urID",_urData] call ALiVE_fnc_ProfileNameSpaceSave;
_urData = "urID" call ProfileNameSpaceLoad;
clear all current mission data
call ALiVE_fnc_ProfileNameSpaceClear
wipe all ALiVE Data from ProfileNameSpace
call ALiVE_fnc_ProfileNameSpaceWipe

[MIL C2ISTAR] Applied ArrayFrameSplitter to TRACE system to quicken up the grid update
[X LIB] Added ALiVE_fnc_arrayFrameSplitter: Splits execution of code in given amount of array blocks and executes each block in unscheduled! f.e. [{_Code},[array with 3000 entries], 30] will split up the arrays to 30 parts  100 entries. The code will be executed in one frame each making it about 30 frames to finish the loop, which prevents the game from locking up on big data.

[X LIB] Added 2 functions to ease up unit detection for custom blacklisting (esp. to support the common request to remove AA units and groups). Details below:
_groupTypes = [_stringToSearchFor, _side or _faction] call ALiVE_fnc_groupFinder;
_entries = [_configPath, stringToSearchFor] call ALiVE_fnc_configFindEntries;
Example:
_groupTypes = ["AA", INDEPENDENT]  call ALiVE_fnc_groupFinder;
_objectTypes = [configFile >> "cfgVehicles", "AA"] call ALiVE_fnc_configFindEntries;
those arrays can basically be easily read and copypasted to whatever blacklist you like (ALiVE_PLACEMENT_CUSTOM_GROUPBLACKLIST, ALiVE_PLACEMENT_CUSTOM_VEHICLEBLACKLIST, ALiVE_PLACEMENT_CUSTOM_UNITBLACKLIST and ALiVE_MIL_CQB_CUSTOM_UNITBLACKLIST)

[MIL OPCOM | MIL CQB | AMB CIV] Insurgency WIP playable (!).... See description below!
Insurgency is set up to use the already built in ALiVE features as best as possible. There are several layers that are tightly tied together:
- Armed Insurgent Cells (SYS PROFILE)
- Civilian insurgents (AMB CIV)
- Close Quarters Battle (CQB)
- Ambient IEDs
- Ambient Suicide bombers
- Roadblocks

Funtionality

Objectives
Objectives of the asymmetric Military Commander will be civilian and military installations, depending on the MIL/CIV Placement modules synced to it.
Type of objectives can be additionally chosen on the placement modules to use specific objective types like power, communications, etc.
Unguarded civilian objectives near to the Ai commanders module (HQ) will have a higher priority than distant guarded military installations.

Armed Insurgent Cells
Depending on objective size, enemy and friendly troop strength as well as overall sector hostility and existing civilian population one or more armed insurgent cells in a section will try to establish appropriate installations like roadblocks, Recruitment HQs, Weapon Depots and IED factories in buildings in the outskirts of the objective.
They will furthermore occupy the area with CQB spawns, plant IEDs, recruit new armed insurgent cells and manipulate the local civilian population to create suicide bombers, rogue enemies, and sabotage installations.
If hostility level eventually allows it, the armed insurgent cells will attack guarded objectives by assaulting them directly or organising ambushes near roads outside of the objective.
As the security level is lowered by successfully terrorizing, attacking and reserving objectives in a sector, the sector hostility is lowered toward the insurgents sides.

Civilian Insurgents
As the armed insurgent cells complete objectives, peaceful ambient civilians are turned into hostile civilian insurgents:
If there is a factory, a weapons depot or a Recruitment HQ in the area, then some of civilians will be ordered to pick up weapons and explosives. This will happen until the installation has been destroyed.
On sabotaging, the selected civilian will move to the given building and plant 3-5 explosives within the building. If they are back at safe distance they will detonate the charges. You can avoid all this by detecting the civilian and killing/arresting him.
There will be suicide bombers, and rogue civilians created that will attack enemy forces! Detect and kill them in time!
In opposite to regular civilians the insurgent civilians carry explosives or magazines in their inventory and have been set with the setvariable "ALiVE_INSURGENT" (true or nil) for further usage like searching, arresting or waterboarding.
A special note to Recruitment
If armed Insurgent Cells manage to set up a Recruitment HQ at a nearby civilian objective, every 15-30 minutes an armed terror cell is created for every civilian agent in at the objective until the Recruitment HQ has been destroyed.
Setup
As its WIP and please mind to use the following minimum setup:
Required ALIVE
SYS Profile
AMB CIV + POP
MIL IED (everything off)
MIL/CIV MP <sync> MIL OPCOM ASYM <sync> CQB

Please mind its still WIP
